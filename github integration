✅ 1. Built-in CI/CD: GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions allows you to automate workflows like building, testing, and deploying applications.

🔧 Example: CI pipeline for a Node.js app
yaml

# .github/workflows/nodejs.yml
name: Node.js CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: 18
    - run: npm install
    - run: npm test
✅ Triggers on every push/pull request to main, installs dependencies, and runs tests.

  

✅ 2. Pull Requests: Review and Merge Changes
Pull Requests (PRs) are used to:

Propose code changes

Get peer reviews

Run automated tests before merging

🔧 Example: Workflow
Dev creates a feature branch: git checkout -b feature/login-api

Pushes code: git push origin feature/login-api

Creates PR on GitHub: Reviewers get notified

GitHub Actions run tests automatically

After approval, it's merged into main

🔁 Ensures clean code, peer review, and no broken features in main.

  

✅ 3. Webhooks: Trigger Events Like Jenkins/Slack
Webhooks send HTTP POST payloads to a URL when something happens in the repo.

🔧 Example: Jenkins CI Trigger from GitHub
In GitHub:

Go to your repo → Settings → Webhooks → Add Webhook

URL: http://<your-jenkins-url>/github-webhook/

Content type: application/json

Trigger: Push events

In Jenkins:

Create a Jenkins pipeline job

Enable “GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling”

✅ Now, whenever you push to GitHub, Jenkins gets triggered automatically.

🔧 Example: Slack Notification Webhook
In Slack: Create an Incoming Webhook URL

In GitHub Actions:

yaml
Copy
Edit
- name: Slack Notify
  uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@v1.23.0
  with:
    payload: |
      {
        "text": "✅ CI Passed for ${{ github.repository }} on commit ${{ github.sha }}"
      }
  env:
    SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}


✅ 4. Integration with Other Tools
🔧 Jira Integration
Link GitHub commits/issues to Jira tickets

Example commit message:
git commit -m "JIRA-123: Fixed login redirect bug"

If Jira + GitHub are connected (via GitHub Marketplace or Jira Cloud), this will link your PR/commit directly to the Jira ticket.

🔧 Jenkins Integration
Use GitHub repo as source in Jenkins job

Add Jenkins GitHub plugin

Enable GitHub webhook triggers as above

🔧 VS Code Integration
Install GitHub extension in VS Code

You can:

Clone/push/pull from GitHub

Create & review pull requests inside the editor

Use GitHub Copilot for code suggestions

# 🔧 Terraform Integration
Store your .tf files in GitHub

Use GitHub Actions to run Terraform:


- name: Terraform Init
  run: terraform init

- name: Terraform Plan
  run: terraform plan

- name: Terraform Apply
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  run: terraform apply -auto-approve
✅ Full GitOps workflow: Infra changes go through PR + review + automation!
