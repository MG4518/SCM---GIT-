# cloning a project repo using visual studio code

Step 1: Open Visual Studio Code and Set Up Git
Open Visual Studio Code.

Make sure Git is installed. You can check by running the following command in the VS Code terminal:


git --version
If Git is not installed, download and install it from Git's official website.

Step 2: Clone the Repository
Open VS Code Terminal (Shortcut: Ctrl + ~).

Run the following command to clone the source repository:


git clone https://github.com/iam-veeramalla/three-tier-architecture-demo.git
Navigate into the cloned repository:


cd three-tier-architecture-demo
Step 3: Create a New Repository on GitHub
Go to your GitHub account: GitHub.

Create a new repository named 3-Tier (https://github.com/MG4518/3-Tier).

DO NOT initialize it with a README.md or .gitignore (since we're pushing an existing repo).

Step 4: Push the Cloned Repository to Your New GitHub Repository
Remove the existing remote reference:


git remote remove origin
Add your new GitHub repository as the new remote:


git remote add origin https://github.com/MG4518/3-Tier.git
Verify the new remote URL:


git remote -v
Expected output:


origin  https://github.com/MG4518/3-Tier.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/MG4518/3-Tier.git (push)
Step 5: Push the Repository to Your GitHub Account
Add all files:


git add .
Commit the changes:


git commit -m "Initial commit: Cloned three-tier-architecture-demo"
Push the repository:


git push -u origin main
If the main branch doesn't exist, use:


git push -u origin master
Step 6: Verify the Push on GitHub
Go to your GitHub repository:
https://github.com/MG4518/3-Tier

Ensure all files are available.
